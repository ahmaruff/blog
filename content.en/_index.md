# Hola, Amigos!

I’m Ahmad Ma’ruf, a software developer with a focus on backend development and system design.
This blog serves as my personal space to document what I’m working on, learning, and thinking about in the world of software engineering.

Most of the content here revolves around:

- Backend development
- APIs and system architecture
- Real-world project experiences
- problem-solving in production environments

The posts are practical and reflective — based on real cases I encounter in my daily work as an engineer.

Thanks for stopping by.
If you’re interested in discussing backend engineering, remote work, or potential collaborations, feel free to reach out.
