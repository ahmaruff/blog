# Hola, Amigos!

I’m Ahmad Ma’ruf — a so-called software developer (lol).
This blog is where I dump things I’m working on, thinking about, or learning.
Most of it is about coding, backend stuff, toy projects, or just small notes so I don’t forget.

Sometimes it’s super technical, sometimes it’s just random scribbles that aren’t really important.
But everything is written with one goal: to remind myself — and maybe, just maybe, it’s useful for someone else too.

No big targets, no fancy roadmap.
The point is just to write — so my thoughts don’t pile up only in my head.

Thanks for stopping by.
If you feel like chatting, feel free to reach out anytime.
