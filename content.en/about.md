I am a software developer focused on Web Development. This page serves as a space to share my personal notes on what I am learning, the projects I am working on,
and my day-to-day experiences in the world of technology.

This blog is primarily a personal documentation space, where each post reflects my learning process, challenges encountered, and solutions discovered along the way.

### Professional Journey

I began exploring the IT world during school and university, ranging from network administration, web development, to foundational understanding of AI/ML.

Throughout my career, I have mainly worked as a fullstack web developer, primarily using **PHP (Laravel)**,
and have been involved in developing internal systems, e-commerce platforms, as well as integrating with third-party services like WhatsApp Cloud and OpenAI.

These experiences have given me opportunities to understand how to build systems that are simple, efficient, and maintainable, while continuously learning to improve code quality and architecture design.

I also enjoy outdoor activities occasionally, such as **hiking, exercising**, or simply taking a walk to unwind from screen time.
